# NIC (Nebari Infrastructure Core) Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-04

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development priorities for Nebari Infrastructure Core (NIC), a Go CLI that deploys production-ready Kubernetes platforms with foundational software, enabling composable "Software Packs" via the Nebari Operator.

### Priority Definitions

- **Now**: In progress or immediate next work
- **Next**: After current work completes
- **Later**: Important but not immediate
- **Someday**: Good ideas, no committed timeline

### Status Definitions

- **In Progress**: Active development underway
- **Shovel Ready**: Well-defined, ready to start when prioritized
- **Needs Refinement**: Concept clear, details need work
- **Needs Research**: Discovery required before implementation
- **Back Burner**: Deprioritized, revisit later
